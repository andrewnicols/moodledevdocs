Projects for new developers
===========================

If you are looking for small projects to get started on as a new developer then you're in the right place.

Each of these projects has been suggested by an experienced Moodle Developer as a potential project to introduce you to
the Moodle development processes, and to different parts of the Moodle codebase.

You may also like to consider adopting a plugin seeking a new maintainer. See the :ref:`Plugins adoption programme
<contributing:Plugins adoptions programme>`

As you become more involved in Moodle development, you might like to learn more about the coding conventions used and how changes to Moodle core code are processed.

This evolving page lists possible Moodle projects for new developers derived from community suggestions and lists projects together with experienced core developers willing to mentor new developers.

If you have any ideas for new features in Moodle which might be suitable as projects for new developers, please see New feature ideas.

Additional notes for GSOC Students
----------------------------------

If you are considering working on one of these projects, or combining several of these projects, as a `Google Summer of
Code`_ Project please note that we require prospective students to make an attempt at fixing at least 1 issue in the
Moodle tracker before their proposal can be considered.

This MUST be completed before your application can be considered valid.
