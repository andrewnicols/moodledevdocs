Migrate end-to-end testing support in the Mobile App to Ionic 3
---------------------------------------------------------------

Protractor is an end-to-end test framework for AngularJS applications. Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.


There are almost 167 e2e tests in the Mobile app (see detailed information here).

The aim of this project is to upgrade the existing end-to-end testing support in the Mobile app to Ionic 3 (the original tests were implemented for Ionic 1/AngularJS).

Tasks
^^^^^

* Upgrade the Node, Protractor and dependencies versions to be able to run tests in modern environments.
* Update all the tests so they can run in the new version of the framework (Ionic 3)
* Update Moodle Mobile documentation with new instructions for setting up both environments.

Requirement for prospective students
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* We require prospective students to set-up and run in a local environment the existing tests following this documentation: Moodle Mobile End To End Testing, student must record a video of the tests running on a local machine.
* We also require students to create an additional test (detailed instructions for writing tests are available in the previous link)
