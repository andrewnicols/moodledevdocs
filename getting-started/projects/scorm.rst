Improving the Moodle SCORM Plugin
=================================

There are a number of areas of SCORM that could be improved. Some of these are bigger projects and others could be combined to form a single project.

These are just some examples, take a look at the open SCORM issues in the Moodle tracker for a list of other issues.
.. :todo Link to the tracker here.

* Improve Grading (MDL-51086, MDL-52871, MDL-37421)
* Improve validation of SCORM packages (MDL-38060, MDL-24057)
* Convert YUI Treeview to use Native JS (Moodle is moving away from YUI and the existing Treeview has a few issues)
* Choose where to send users after completing SCORM (MDL-61677)
