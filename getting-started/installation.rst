Installation
============

This document will show you how to get your first development environment configured.
You can have your first Moodle site setup in less than five minutes, ready to develop your first plugin, submit your
first bug fix, or work on your first theme.

There are several ways to run with Moodle, but if you're new to this, we'd recommend that you :ref:`start with Docker <getting-started/installation:Using Docker>`.
If you already have your own development environment fully configured, then you probably want to take a look at
:ref:`installing Moodle locally <getting-started/installation:Install locally>` documentation.

Using Docker
------------

This guide assumes that you already have `Docker`_ installed. If not, head on over to the `Installing Docker`_
documentation first.

Moodle has released a series of Docker images which allow testing of the full range of supported :ref:`Database servers
<requirements:Supported Database Servers>`
